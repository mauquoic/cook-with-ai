I am a busy person. We all are. We don't like reading through useless stuff.

For this reason, I do not understand why in every cooking blog, you first have to read through 50 paragraphs
about the person's life to finally get to the recipe...

The other issue I regularly face is the units. Being from Europe, I hate imperial units. They make zero sense.
Which is why the above problem can be even more infuriating.

Well, no more! In this blog, we get straight to the point! We provide ingredients and instructions. That's it.
The recipes are all generated by AI, which is a fun twist.

The most "clutter" that may appear is an AI generated image, or a picture of the result. But if so, don't you
worry - it'll be at the bottom!

Enjoy cooking! :)
