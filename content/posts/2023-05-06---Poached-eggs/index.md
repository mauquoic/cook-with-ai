Poached eggs are a versatile ingredient that can be used in a variety of dishes. Whether you're making Eggs
Benedict, adding them to salads, or serving them on toast, perfectly poached eggs are a must-have in any
cook's arsenal. This recipe will teach you how to make poached eggs that are tender, delicious, and perfectly
cooked every time.

### Ingredients

- Eggs
- White vinegar
- Water

### Instructions

1. Fill a large saucepan with 2-3 inches of water and bring to a gentle simmer. Add a splash of white
   vinegar to the water.
2. Crack one egg into a small bowl or ramekin.
3. Use a spoon to create a gentle whirlpool in the simmering water, then carefully slide the egg into the center of the whirlpool. Repeat with the remaining eggs.
4. Poach the eggs for 3-4 minutes or until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
5. Use a slotted spoon to remove the eggs from the water and place them on a plate lined with paper towels.
6. Serve the poached eggs immediately, seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.

### Tips

1. Use fresh eggs: Fresh eggs will have a firmer egg white, which will make it easier to poach them without
   the whites becoming too thin.
2. Add vinegar to the poaching water: Adding vinegar to the water will help the egg whites coagulate more
   quickly and prevent them from spreading out too much.
3. Don't overcook the eggs: For a perfectly runny yolk, poach the eggs for 3-4 minutes or until the whites
   are set but the yolks are still runny.
4. Use a slotted spoon: Using a slotted spoon to remove the eggs from the water will help drain off any excess
   water and prevent the eggs from breaking.
5. Experiment with seasonings: Poached eggs are versatile and can be seasoned with a variety of flavors.
   Try adding spices like paprika or cumin, or herbs like chives or parsley to add some extra flavor to your
   poached eggs.
