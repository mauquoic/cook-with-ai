This creamy pumpkin soup is the ultimate comfort food for fall. Made with fresh pumpkin, aromatic spices, and
a touch of cream, this warm and hearty soup is sure to warm you up on a cool autumn evening. Serve with crusty
bread for a perfect meal.

### Ingredients

- 1 medium-sized pumpkin, peeled and diced
- 2 medium-sized onions, chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 4 tbsp butter
- 4 cups (1 liter) chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 cup (250ml) heavy cream
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley or thyme, chopped, for garnish

### Instructions

1. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and minced garlic, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the diced pumpkin and stir to combine. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Pour in the stock, bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer until the pumpkin is very tender, about 20 minutes.
4. Using an immersion blender or a blender in batches, puree the soup until smooth.
5. Stir in the heavy cream, and season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Serve the soup hot, garnished with chopped parsley or thyme.

### Tips

- Use fresh pumpkin for the best flavor. An older pumpkin may make the soup more bitter.
- Try roasting the pumpkin for a deeper flavor.
- Experiment with different spices to find your desired level of seasoning.
- Make sure to puree the soup until it is smooth and creamy.
- Serve with a garnish of freshly chopped herbs or croutons for texture and taste.
