Eggs Benedict is a classic brunch dish that's sure to impress your guests. Perfectly poached eggs, buttery
English muffins, and silky smooth Hollandaise sauce come together to create a dish that's as delicious as it is
elegant. Follow this simple recipe for a restaurant-quality Eggs Benedict at home.

### Ingredients

- 4 English muffins, split and toasted
- 8 slices Canadian bacon or ham
- 8 eggs
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 3 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- Salt and cayenne pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

### Instructions

1. Toast the English muffins and warm the Canadian bacon or ham in a skillet. Keep warm while
   preparing the rest of the recipe.
2. Fill a large saucepan with 2-3 inches of water and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the white vinegar
   to the water.
3. Crack one egg into a small bowl or ramekin. Use a spoon to create a gentle whirlpool in the simmering
   water, then carefully slide the egg into the center of the whirlpool. Repeat with the remaining eggs.
4. Poach the eggs for 3-4 minutes or until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
5. While the eggs are poaching, make the Hollandaise sauce. In a small saucepan, whisk together the egg yolks
   and lemon juice until light and frothy.
6. Gradually whisk in the melted butter, whisking constantly, until the sauce thickens and becomes creamy.
7. Season the sauce with salt and cayenne pepper to taste.
8. To assemble, place two English muffin halves on each plate. Top each half with a slice of Canadian bacon or ham,
   then a poached egg.
9. Spoon the Hollandaise sauce over the top of each egg.
10. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately.

### Tips

1. Use fresh eggs: Fresh eggs will have a firmer egg white, which will make it easier to poach them without
   the whites becoming too thin.
2. Add vinegar to the poaching water: Adding vinegar to the water will help the egg whites coagulate more
   quickly and prevent them from spreading out too much.
3. Don't overcook the eggs: For a perfectly runny yolk, poach the eggs for 3-4 minutes or until the whites
   are set but the yolks are still runny.
4. Keep the Hollandaise sauce warm: Hollandaise sauce can quickly solidify if it cools down, so keep it
   warm in a double boiler or by placing the saucepan in a larger pan of hot water.
5. Experiment with toppings: While Canadian bacon or ham are the classic toppings for Eggs Benedict,
   you can also try other proteins such as smoked salmon or spinach for a vegetarian version.
